### Code

Learned some new tricks that I may be taking advantage of to make my life a little bit easier and wanted to jot them down so I don't forget.

#### Watch

Chrome dev tools offers watch <br> ![image](/assets/images/watch.png) <br> You set local variables in it, and then when break points are hit the values will show. This is helpful if there are a bunch of pieces of state you want to look at, then you don't have to type them all out via the console over and over again.

#### Convert JSON to Type

Working in Typescript having valid interfaces for types is essential. A very tedious task is taking an API and creating interfaces for the responses. [This video shows you can easily take the response and convert it into interfaces.](https://youtu.be/u21W_tfPVrY?t=238)

#### Easiest way to undo commit

Whenever I accidentally commit something I always have to look up how to properly revert it. Luckily VSCode has this built in. ![image](/assets/images/undoLastCommit.JPG) Your last changed files will then be in the "Changes" section and from there you can discard them or make a quick fix.

### Music

Discovered [Sigrid](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigrid_(singer)>) today. While it's definitely not rap, it's upbeat and lots of fun. Favourite songs so far (which I think are her most popular) [Stranger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIriwVhRPVA) and [High Five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6A2LHGx8_A1). She also did a great [acoustic set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t5ygDexACI) with an outstanding "back-up" singer.
