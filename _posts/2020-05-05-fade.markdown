### Code

If you're using [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) you may be using the [styles](https://material-ui.com/styles/basics/) package to dynamically style your components. I learned about the `fade` function today which was very helpful.

The problem I was trying to solve was using a dynamic colour with an opacity in our style sheet.
My original solution was to hardcode the colour with a comment like such:

```
// Our colour
rgba(100,100,100, 0.5)
```

However, using `fade` allowed me to keep both the dynamic colour and opacity:

```
fade(theme.palette.error.main, 0.15)
```

### Music

I've really been into Aries lately. I heard it was "emo-rap" but it feels pretty upbeat to me. The first single [BAD NEWS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osE9DTIr7hg) gets me ready for the day of coding ahead.
