### Why should I read this blog?

This is a place for me to document things I've learned, so you might learn something new as well. Also you might discover some new music.

### "Spittin' Scripts? What's that about?"

I like rap music and I like code. It's also the best alliteration I could think of.

### Who am I?

My name is Conner Leverett and I'm an intermediate software developer at [Geocortex](https://www.geocortex.com/).

### Education

UVic 2017 BSc Geomatics (Combined Geography and Compuyer Science)

### How'd you get to where you are?

I had a great high school Geography teacher, this led me to taking Geography at UVic. The first two years were general but then I discovered GIS (Geographic Information Systems (or Science depending on where you're from)) and Remote Sensing. I really enojoyed the problem solving involved, instead of just writing papers. I felt that it was more important (and employable) to be able to program the software, then just use it. So I joined the combined program and the rest is history.
